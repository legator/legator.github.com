Medium is an online publishing platform - from Wikipedia. As I think it is similar for blogger, WordPress blog, habrahabr etc. Founder of this platform is co-founder of blogger, so my suggestion is right.
So this platform allowed publishing information relative to different topics - ai, algorithm, medical, philosophy, sex etc. I think this platform want to be as YouTube but for written information.
More then 6 months ago I created an account and followed interesting for me topics:
<ul>
    <li>NLP - I was starred interesting of this topic at University.</li>
    <li>AI - for my PhD work.</li>
    <li>Algorithm - each developer should know basic algorithms.</li>
    <li>JavaScript - my bad side of coding.</li>
    <li>ioT - my hobby.</li>
    <li>Architecture of system, microservices - for my feature))</li>
    <li>DB - all bissness logic on SQL.</li>
</ul>
Each day I opened my list of new entry - shortly read title, review of content and mark for read later if it was interested for me. And at the end of week I review all marked posts.
Each week I review maybe 50 posts and 10-15 posts marked for later and maybe 1 or 2 of this posts are really interested for me because most of this posts have general information and you spent a lot of time for nothing. And the problem of relevance of contents for me is really interesting.

UPD: After 2 months I didn`t visit this site for more than 5 months.
