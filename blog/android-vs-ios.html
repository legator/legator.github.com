You can find a lot of stories/posts/threads about comparisons Android and iOS, but this story about how to configure smart home on IOS or Android. My the first phone was Nokia with Symbion OS - in that time we knew nothing about smart home or iot, but on another hand - it was a really good smartphone.
The next phone was Nexus 4 - the best Android phone made by LG in that time. And less then one year ago I bought iPhone SE. But the next my phone will be on Android.
So, there are reasons:
<ul>
    <li>
        Android OS is opened for developers. I am a developer and it gives me to write needed applications or services. I don't want to buy developer licenses or something like this. I want to create applications only for me only)) On Android I have access to the battery, call etc and share status it with other applications. I use several rules on IFTTT for Android device but with my iPhone it is not working.
    </li>
    <li>
        I really like Chromecast. I don't have smart TV or tv box and Chromecast is the best solution in this situation. But I have a problem with connection iPhone to Cast: cannot share a screen, cannot share browser, there are no good players for iOS. iOS only support Apple TV but there are a lot of tvs with build-in Chromecast. And yes, Apple will be ignored this technology.
    </li>
    <li>
        There is no good app for IPTV. My internet providers provide IPTV service, but on my iPhone this is unused.
    </li>
    <li>
        I like such program as xmusic match, messager from Facebook etc with it notifications and additional views. But on iPhone it is absent.
    </li>
    <li>
        I am using Google services and it is useful to log in once in a device and then use this account in another app.
    </li>
    <li>
        NFC and pay - it is a really bad situation in IOS. I have several headphones, speakers with NFC - but you cannot use it with your iPhone and you cannot use Google Pay etc - you need to wait for Apple Pay((
    </li>
    <li>
        Google Assistant more "clever" then Siri.
    </li>
    <li>
        One thinks that I like on iOS is that new version of iOS supported different versions of iPhone, because on Android - new phone will be supported during next two years.
    </li>
</ul>
In my mind, people which use iPhone did not know about all benefits that Android gives. They use the iPhone to emphasize their status, but really revolutions made by Samsung, Xiaomi, Google.
