During this week I saw several overview HomePod from Apple. And now I am disappointed. I believe that Apple gives us a new vision of such smart device, gives us new instructions how to use it, how it helps us to live etc. But not at this time - it only soundbar with a high price. I understand that this device for Apple family but you can not configure it from your MacBook or iMac - wtf?
So for 350$, you will have a good sound bar and that's all. But a lot of peoples still buy this product and Apple will report about super profits. Sadly((
