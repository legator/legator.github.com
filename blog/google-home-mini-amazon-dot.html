<h2>Google Home Mini VS Amazon Alexa Dot<br> 
	<a href="../blog/index.html"> &larr; Back</a>

	This is almost a month with <a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/google_home_mini?hl=en-US">Google Home Mini</a> - a voice assistant from Google, a competitor to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Dot-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker-with-Alexa-Black/dp/B01DFKC2SO">Amazon Alexa</a>. Since I also have the small version of Amazon, so I will give some comparison between them and in the general impression from the Google Mini.

	In my opinion, I did not find a review of this product in ex-USSSR segment, except for the <a href="https://youtu.be/gVTGRHv61Bo?t=20">Rosetked</a>, not so popular product in this area.

	As it turned out, the exclusive version of Home Mini came from Google Store - coral - unusual. To the touch is cool but easy to bend (( The first thing that surprises me is that the buttons are virtually absent - only one switch for the microphone. All management is through the gesture and it's cool. Sometimes it difficult to find the buttons that you need at the Amazon Dot.
	A big minus of Google Home it's impossible to properly connect the Bluetooth-speaker directly and there is no output for headphones (although its Apple is actively killing). Sounds like this kind of device is good, somewhat better than Amazon.

	Just a great plus for Home Mini is option to connect to Spotify without a paid account and even a video from youtube to transfer on it - there will be only sound)) Well, of course, it's friends with Google Music))
	Integration is also better in Google Home, because I mostly use the Google services, then the assistant and postal checks with the calendar, etc. Integration within a reasonable house is the same, the difference has not yet been felt.

	In general, such assistants are still quite raw product, especially in my country - there is no understanding of our language - only English, Services that are in our country and few are supported (most likely not available). For the year that I have the Amazon Dot, I have not seen much progress - everything is tied to premium Amazon services. Waiting for a possible revolution from Apple - maybe they come up with a script of use.

	But for now it's just a fun for the geeks.
